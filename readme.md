# Sanitation Worker Safety System

Sanitary workers, numbering around 1.2 million, play a vital role in maintaining sanitation but endure unchanged working conditions for over a century, facing both social injustices and serious health risks. Exposure to hazardous gases, cardiovascular issues, musculoskeletal disorders, and various infections poses significant threats to their well-being.

## Project Overview

This project aims to enhance the safety of sanitation workers by integrating various MQ gas sensors and a health monitor into their helmets. The system collects data during sewer cleaning, transmits it to a supervisor in real-time, and analyzes the information to assess gas concentration levels within the sewer pipeline.

### Features

- **Data Collection:** Sensors detect gases (ammonia, H2S, methane, CO2) and health parameters during sewer cleaning.

- **Transmission:** Collected data is sent to a supervisor in real-time for analysis.

- **Analysis:** Supervisor evaluates the data to assess gas concentration levels within the sewer pipeline.

- **Alert System:** If gas levels exceed safety thresholds, an alert is immediately sent to the cleaner.

- **Safety Precautions:** Cleaner receives the alert, dons a gas mask, and takes necessary precautions for their well-being.

- **Continuous Monitoring:** The device ensures ongoing assessment of working conditions, prioritizing cleaner safety.

- **Communication:** In case of health issues, the supervisor can swiftly contact the cleaner for immediate action.

- **Enhanced Safety:** The device provides a comprehensive overview, optimizing the working environment for sewer cleaners.
